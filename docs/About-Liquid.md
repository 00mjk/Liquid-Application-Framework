The **Liquid Application Framework** is a set of pre-integrated, ready-to-use binding code that supports the creation of [liquid applications](About-Liquid-Applications.md).

It is based on reference [lightweight architectures](About-Lightweight-Architectures.md), cloud design patterns and [modern software engineering](https://www.avanade.com/en/technologies/modern-software-engineering) techniques.

For building business software, Liquid can be thought of as a set of pre-built parts that drives a faster, safer, cheaper development work, while delivering high quality products.

#Liquid boosts the lifecycle of modern applications. How does it do that?
The framework increases the development productivity and quality, while eases operation, of business applications by reducing their complexity through use of pre-built and pre-integrated technical components.

It also adds architectural uniformity and governance by making it possible for software engineers to focus on business domain logic, leaving the technical issues with to the framework.

Last, but not least, Liquid allows for easy and centralized replacement and/or extension of platform components (_e.g._ database server) so applications built on top of it are tech-agnostic, _i.e._ minimizes vendor/platform lock-in.
